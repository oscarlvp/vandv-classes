The initial content of this document was inspired from the (inherited and redefined) conferences taught by Jean-Marc Jézéquel, Yves Le Traon, Benoit Baudry and Benoit Combemale at the University of Rennes. The topics presented in this document have been expanded with content derived from other sources such as the https://cs.gmu.edu/~offutt/softwaretest/["Introduction to Software Testing"] book written by Paul Ammann and Jeff Offutt, https://www.fuzzingbook.org/["The Fuzzing Book"] by Andreas Zeller, Rahul Gopinath, Marcel Böhme, Gordon Fraser, and Christian Holler and the https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3bOx_OjZk8EvOo3un0xeGpXlqGT2YQXa[online material on GUI testing] published by Tanja Vos. Many other bibliographical sources and materials were also used and appear in the <<99-references.adoc#_references,References>> section. All images from external sources retain their respective copyrights.

As part of the course, students have to complete a set of exercises for each topic. These exercises can be consulted in the following links:
