== Graphical User Interface testing

NOTE: The first part of this section and the discussion about Test* follow the same structure as the https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3bOx_OjZk8EvOo3un0xeGpXlqGT2YQXa[online material on GUI testing] published by professor Tanja Vos from the University of Valencia.

Most applications: desktop, mobile, web and even embedded systems from cards and medical equipment have a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The GUI stands between the user and the underlying code of the application and provides access to all the functionalities. It is also the place where users find failures. Therefore, testing the GUI can potentially discover those unwanted failures.

A GUI is conformed by visual elements we call _widgets_. These can be text boxes, checkboxes, buttons, menus, scrollbars and often custom made widgets.  Widgets are usually organized in a tree in which container widgets hold children widgets and so on. Each widget has a set of properties, for example, the position of the widget, the size, the background color, the font and the values it handles like the text in a text box. The concrete values at runtime of these properties conform the state of the widget. By extension, the state of the GUI is conformed by the widget tree and the state of all widgets. Users can affect the state of the GUI by performing actions on the widgets. That is, users can _click_ on a checkbox or a button, enter a text, select an option in a list or drag an image.

.A very simple GUI
image::gui-example.png[GUI example, 600]

<<gui-example>> shows an example of a very simple GUI of a subscription application. The root of the widget tree is a form. This form contains several widgets for users to enter their information: text boxes for the name and email, a combobox to select the country, a submit button and a link. The combobox on its side contains a menu whose children are items corresponding to each possible selection. Initially, the _Name_ text box has as properties: `width = 300`, `height = 15`, `placeholder = "Name"` and `text = ""`. After a user enters her name, then the `text` property changes with the corresponding value. The same goes for the rest of the widgets.

GUI tests are a form of system tests, as they execute the entire application. They are designed from the user's perspective. In general terms, a GUI test initializes the system under test, performs a series of GUI actions and then, it checks if the GUI state is correct.

For our small GUI a test case could be designed as following:

1. Open the subscription form
2. Enter "Jane Doe" in _Name_
3. Enter "jave@example.com" in _Email_
4. Select "Canada" in _Country_
5. Click _Submit_
6. Expect success message

This test checks that a user, entering the right information, is able to subscribe to the system. A test checking if the application detects an error in the data, for example, that the email is valid would do the following:

1. Open the subscription form
2. Enter "Jane Doe" in _Name_
3. Enter "not an email" in _Email_
4. Click _Submit_
5. Expect an error under _Email_

In general, GUI tests should verify that the required information is visible in the screen, that the position and size of the widgets is correct, that the appropriate error messages are shown at the right time and that the application does not crash or closes unexpectedly.

As with the rest of tests, manually executing GUI tests is tedious an extremely error prone, so we need to automate their execution. There are four main approaches to GUI test automation, all with their pros and cons:

Capture and replay:: Tests are executed manually once and a specialized tool records the actions performed by the user. Then, the tests can be executed as many times as we want and the result should be the same. This is a simple option to automate GUI tests that do not require testers to have programming skills. On the other side this form of test is highly sensitive to GUI changes. Any small modification to the interface renders the tests invalid and they have to be recreated again.

Develop test scripts:: We can develop scripts that emulate user actions and query the GUI state. This approach requires programming skills and it is arguably the most appealing for developers. There are plenty of libraries, frameworks and even domain specific languages (DSLs) to develop GUI test scripts for desktop, web and mobile applications, being https://selenium.dev/[Selenium] one of the most used for the web. These tests can be usually integrated with testing frameworks like JUnit. As with other forms of tests, these have to be maintained and changed whenever the GUI changes. <<simple-selenium-test>> shows an implementation of a test verifying that the application shows an error if the user forgets to enter the name. It uses Selenium combined with JUnit and Hamcrest.

    Select countrySelector = new Select(driver.findElement(By.id("country"))); //<3>
    countrySelector.selectByValue("Canada"); //<4>

    driver.findElement(By.id("submit")).click(); //<5>

    List<WebElement> errors =  driver.findElements(By.className("error")); //<6>
    assertThat(errors, hasSize(1)); //<7>

<3> Find the combobox for the country.
<4> Enter `Canada` as the country value.
<5> Find and click the `Submit` button.
<6> Find error elements in the page.
<7> Check that there is at least one error element.
+
However, the code of this test is hard to follow, as it contains many GUI queries cluttering its actual intent. This particular test is also tangled with the GUI design. For example, errors are discovered by finding HTML elements with an `error` class. If the GUI design changes, we need to change this part of the code in all tests doing the same. Therefore we need to find a way to develop these tests so they have a simpler code and are robust to changes. We shall discuss the _Page Object Model_ <<fowler2013page>> pattern for this matter.

Visual scripts:: An interesting alternative to test scripts. The widgets participating in the tests are specified using images from screen captures of the application. The test execution uses image recognition techniques to detect the position of the widgets. https://eyeautomate.com/[EyeAutomate] provides a set of tools to achieve this. While it is a simple alternative to put into practice, it still requires a sophisticated machinery underneath and it is still highly sensitive to GUI changes.

Automated GUI testing:: In the previous section we saw that we can automatically generate interesting test inputs and even test code. GUI tests are not an exception on that. Automating the GUI testing process requires a way to obtain the GUI state and the possible GUI actions. This allows to execute the application and automatically decide a sequence of actions to perform and a way to check the consistency of the GUI state. This can be seen as a type of fuzzing directed to the user actions as the input domain of the application. https://testar.org/[Test*] implements this idea and automatically check the robustness of applications against random actions.

In the remaining sections we shall discuss how to write our GUI tests with the help of Selenium and how tools like Test* achieve GUI test automation.

=== Writing test scripts

<<simple-selenium-test>> shows an example of a test written with Selenium to check the response of the subscription form when the user forgets to enter her name.

Selenium is a set of libraries and tools designed to automate the interaction with web browsers. Although it is widely used for testing, it can be employed in many other automation tasks. Its core functionalities are based on the _WebDriver_, an API that makes possible to inspect remotely control browsers by emulating user actions and allows code to inspect the content presented by the browser. Other alternatives like https://pptr.dev/[Puppeteer] do the same based on the Chrome DevTools protocol.

Concrete WebDrivers are specific to each browser, but the API is general enough so the code we write works no matter the browser we are using. In <<simple-selenoum-test>> we can notice that it is possible to search for web elements using their identifiers `By.id` or style class name `By.className`. We see that we can send keyboard input with `sendKeys`, select an element with `selectByValue` and even `click` on web page elements. The functionalities of Selenium go way beyond this basic operations as they permit to inspect every aspect of the web page and to build more complex interactions like drag and drops.

Suppose we want to write a similar test case for our application to verify the scenario in which the user forgets to enter the country. The code will be pretty much the same as before. But we know applications change in time. In particular, the GUI changes to improve the user experience, make the application more appealing or because we are incorporating a new framework with better user controls. 

If, for example, we decide to show errors differently, or we decide to change the way the country is selected, then we have to change the code of all test cases we wrote this way. The GUI changed but the requirements are the same: there should be an error when the user forgets some of the form values. The test cases should be changed for technical reasons and tests should reflect more the requirements than the application implementation. Also, the GUI queries to obtain the visual elements are interweaved inside the test code. This makes the test case harder to read and understand. Its intent gets hidden by the machinery to build the tests.

The _Page Object Model_ is a code design pattern that precisely aims at solving these two issues. Here we illustrate the pattern with a web application, but it could be used to test other forms of GUI as well.

==== Page Object Model

_Page Object Model_ or simply _Page Object_ is a design pattern that proposes to separate the test code from the page/GUI specific code <<fowler2013page>>. The main idea is to create classes to model each page in our application. These classes shall become the interface between the tests and the GUI. Page objects should allow the tests to do and see anything human users would do while providing a simple programming interface. 

In a page object, any information exposed by the page, should become a property, any action a user can do should become a behavior or method of the class. This is an Object-Oriented approach to encapsulate GUI specific code and hide the structural complexity of the GUI. If the GUI changes, then only the page objects will change and not the test code. <<page-object-example>> shows how the test case from <<simple-selenium-test>> could be written with a page object `SubscribePage` representing the subscription page. The `SubscribePage` has methods to emulate the possible actions: `typeEmail`, `selectCountry` and `submit`. It also has _accessors_ to retrieve this information and the errors shown in the page.

[[page-object-example, Listing {counter:listing}]]
.Listing {listing}. Rewriting the test case shown in <<simple-selenium-test>> using a page object.
[source, java]
----
@Test
public void testMissingName() {
    driver.get("http://localhost:5000");
    SubscribePage page = new SubscribePage(driver);
    page.typeEmail("jane@example.com")
            .selectCountry("Canada")
            .submit();
    assertThat(page.errors(), hasSize(1));
}
----

When creating page objects there is no need to represent the entire page, not even all pages in the application. We should focus on what is essential for testing. Doing otherwise will create an unnecessary burden as these objects have to be maintained. On the other hand, a page object may be composed by other page objects representing recurrent components in the application. Page objects should not contain assertions, so they can be reused among different tests, but they may include general purpose checks, for example, verify that the  webdriver navigates the right page and that application the hasn't crashed.

Let's explore this pattern in a more complete example. We shall use Selenium from Java to test the https://github.com/barais/doodlestudent[Simba Organizer] web application. This application is composed by a backend developed in Java using https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus] and a frontend developed in TypeScript using https://angular.io/[Angular] and third party libraries like https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/[PrimeNG] and https://fullcalendar.io/[FullCalendar].

WARNING: Testing an Angular application from Java using Selenium is not the ideal option. However, it is feasible and the Java+Selenium stack can be applied to web applications developed in any other framework than Angular. For Angular applications the best choice is to use https://www.protractortest.org/[Protractor].

Simba Organizer is a teaching project used in different student assignments at https://istic.univ-rennes1.fr/[ISTIC], University of Rennes 1. It is  a doodle-like application that allows a set of users to agree on the schedule of a meeting. One user creates an initial poll to decide the schedule of a meeting and proposes some time slots. Then the participants shall pick the option that best fits their availability and possibly send some comments. The application also interacts with services to create a shared pad for the meeting, to create a chatroom and to let users check their calendars when picking the time slot.

The workflow to create a poll for a meeting starts with a landing page shown in <<simba-starting-page>>. This page shows some instructions and the only action a user can do is to click the button at the bottom to start creating a poll. The actual poll creation page can be directly accessed, then modeling the landing page is not essential.

[[simba-starting-page]]
[role=text-center]
.Landing page of Simba Organizer
image::simba-start-page.png[Landing page, 600]

The poll creation page is shown in <<simba-information-page>>. In this page a user must enter the general information of the meeting: mandatory title and place, optional description and whether the meeting will include a meal. Then, the user must click _Next_ to move into the next creation step. If the user forgets one of the mandatory elements, then an error will be shown and the page will not change.

[role=text-center]
.Meeting poll initial page. The user must enter a title a place and optionally a description, to be able to go to the next step.
image::simba-information-page.png[Meeting poll page, 600]

This page can be modeled by the class shown in <<simba-information-page-model>>. The class has a constructor taking the `WebDriver` it should use to locate the web elements and interact with the browser. The class includes getter or accessor methods for all values shown in the form: title, place, description and `hasMeal` to know whether this value has been selected. In general, the accessor should be simple, they just find somehow the web element and returns the corresponding value. The result type of these methods should be as simple as possible: primitive types, string or simple data types. The goal is to reflect what is shown in the page and nothing more. Notice in the code how `title` was implemented: we use the driver to locate an input web element with id `titre` and then return the text value. Each action is represented as a method returning a page object. The implementation of `typeTitle` first finds the element and then instructs the browser to type the corresponding value. There may two possible outcomes when the user clicks _Next_: if there is an error the page does not change and error messages are shown. Otherwise the application shows the next step. We model these two scenarios with methods `next` and `nextExectingErrors`. Having two separate methods for this makes the test more readable and keeps the implementation simpler.

public class InformationPage {

     }

    public InformationPage typeTitle(String value) { 
        return driver.findElement(By.id("titre")).sendKeys(value);
     }

    public String place() { ... }

    public InformationPage typePlace(String value) { ... }

    public String description() { ... }

    public DateselectionPage next() {
        driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("p-button[label=Next]")).click();
        return new DateselectionPage(driver);

    }

    public InformationPage nextExpectingErrors() {
        driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("p-button[label=Next]")).click();
        return this;
    }

}
----

In <<simba-information-page-model>> we have repeated `driver.findElement` queries several times. These can be avoided by simply having instance fields holding the right value and filling them in the construction. Selenium also provides some functionalities to make this simpler and more declarative using annotations. This is shown in <<using-annotations-webelements>>. We annotate fields with the corresponding element selectors and call `PageFactory.initElements` will handle their creation and assignment.

    private WebElement nextButton;

    public InformationPage(WebDriver driver) {
        Objects.requireNonNull(driver);
        this.driver = driver;
        PageFactory.initElements(driver, this);
    }

    public String title() {
        return titleInput.getText();
    }

    public InformationPage nextExpectingErrors() {
        nextButton.click();
        return this;
    }

    ...
}
----

Once the user specifies the initial information of the meeting the application shows a page where she can select the initial options for the time slots. This page is shown in <<simba-date-options>>. This page shows a calendar component where the user can create the time slots. It has also a switch the user can activate to enter a URL to an _iCalendar_ feed so she can check her own time occupation. The user can move to the next stop at any time since it is not mandatory to set these initial options for the poll.

[[simba-date-options]]
[role=text-center]
.Page to select date options. The user may select time slots using the calendar component/widget. Optionally she can add her own ICS calendar to see her own time occupation.
image::simba-date-options.png[Date options, 600]

This page is particularly challenging for testing. On the one hand, the interaction with the calendar is rather complex. Users should click, drag and release the mouse to create an event in the calendar. Furthermore, users can even edit the events they have already created. On the other hand, fetching the iCalendar feed is an asynchronous operation which posses timing problems.

We should make page object models as simple as possible, since they must be updated each time the GUI changes. So, we should not aim at implementing all the calendar functionalities, besides, this a third party component that we may change at any time and we are not interested in testing it. At this point we assume it works correctly.

For the asynchronous operations we have not better solution than to wait until its result become visible. But also, we must set a reasonable timeout for the wait, so in case the operation fails and never sends back the results the test can also fail. These timeouts are often sources of flaky tests as we saw in previous sections so they must be handled with care.

<<simba-date-options-model>> shows how we can model this page. The purpose of this page is to select the initial time slot proposals. This is achieved with `addOption`. The method takes only the start and end `LocalDateTime` instances to create the slot. `LocalDateTime` is a class included in the `java.time` package. Inside, the method should interact with the calendar component to click in the right places. This may be hard. Since this is an Angular application we can also interact directly with the JavaScript code, which breaks a bit the encapsulation but might be simpler. There is no easy solution for this. However, implementing `addOption` hides all this complexity form the tests and makes the operation reusable. On its side, the `options` method returns the time slots we added to the calendar. `Slot` is a simple data class we created to represent a pair of start and end `LocalDateTime`.

[[simba-date-options-model, Listing {counter:listing}]]
.Listing {listing}. A model for the time slots selection page.
[source, java]
----
public class DateSelectionPage {

    public DateSelectionPage(WebDriver driver) { ... }

    public boolean hasICS() { ... }

    public DateSelectionPage setHasICS(boolean value) { ... }

    public boolean isICSVisible() { ... }

    public String ICS() { ... }

    public DateSelectionPage typeICS(String value) { ... }

    public DateSelectionPage addOption(LocalDateTime start, LocalDateTime end) { ... }

    public List<Slot> options() { ... }

    public List<Slot> ICSEvents() { ... }

    public SummaryPage next() { ... }

    public InformationPage back() { ... }

}
----

If the user wants to consult her iCalendar, she must activate the switch, then a text box appears and she should enter the right URL there. Then, the events are fetched and shown in the calendar. All these operations are encapsulated in `setHasICS` to activate or deactivate the switch, `isICSVisible` to know if the text box is visible, `ICS` to get the value specified for the iCalendar URL, `typeICS` to set the value and `ICSEvents` to consult the events displayed in the calendar. Typing the iCalendar URL needs the text box to be visible. While the operation seems immediate after we activate the switch we have to be sure that the web element is visible. We can instruct the driver to wait for such things, <<waiting-for-visibility>> shows how we can do that.

[[waiting-for-visibility, Listing {counter:listing}]]
.Listing {listing}. A snippet of code showing how we can wait for an element to be visible.
[source, java]
----
int timeout = 10;
WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, timeout);
WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.id("ics"));
ExpectedCondition<Webelement> condition = ExpectedConditions.visibilityOf(element), timeout);
wait.until(condition);
----

The rest of the class is similar to the previous model: it has methods to access the information and method to go to the previous and next steps. When creating page object models it might be a good idea to have a base class, in which we can put all the common actions, for example, navigation methods, the waiting code and default timeouts. Then all the models we write can extend this base class.

After the poll has been created, the application displays a summary page shown in <<simba-summary-page>>. 

[[simba-summary-page]]
[role=text-center]
.Poll summary page with links to a page for the participants, an admin page to modify and close the poll and links to a shared pad and a chatroom provided by external services.
image::simba-summary-page.png[Summary page, 600]

The model is simple, it just provides access to the URLs and method to navigate to the administration and participation pages. The chatroom and pad URLs are provided by third party services. We may opt not to create page object models for them or to create very simple classes to query the content of the pages to see if the information is correct, but nothing more since we do not want to test external components.

The poll administration page is shown in <<simba-admin-page>>. It shows the title, the place, if there is a meal planned for the meeting, comments from the participants, each option, and buttons to select the final option and close the poll. It also has links to create a new poll, to modify the existing poll, to go to the chatroom, the pad and even to share the poll. The model is shown in <<simba-admin-page-model>>. It is similar to the models before. The new aspect here is that we have modeled each option visual section as a different page object. This reduces the complexity of the `AdminPage` code.

As with any solution the _Page Object Mode_ design pattern may not fit every scenario. Its misuse may bring more harm than good. It is usually argued that page object models are hard to maintain and are not well documented <<bahmutov2019stop>>. Like any other form of testing, GUI tests are subject to code smells, so we need to watch for code repetition, insufficient abstractions, and hard-to-understand code.

If a GUI has too much logic embedded, then implementing Page Object Model is challenging as the application becomes less testable. Development patterns like _Model-View-Controller_, _Model-View-Presenter_ and _Model-View-ViewModel_ or _Passive View_ propose ways to organize the application code so the GUI has less logic and, as a result, it becomes easier to test. Also, interacting with the _Controller_, _Presenter_ or the _ViewModel_ can be easier than interacting directly with the visual elements <<fowler2006passive>>.

=== Fully automated GUI testing

As said before, a GUI test initializes the system under test, performs a series of GUI actions and then it checks if the GUI state is correct. If we can automatically discover which actions can be done at any instant during the execution of a program and if we can automatically compare application states, then we can automatically generate GUI tests. In fact, if we consider the set of GUI/user actions as the input domain, we can fuzz graphical applications by generating random action sequences.

https://testar.org/[Test*] (reads as Testar) is a research tool implementing an automated GUI random testing process. The general workflow is shown in <<testar>>.

The process starts the _System Under Test_ (SUT) and optionally instruments its code to obtain more information during the execution of user actions. Then, it scans the GUI to obtain sthe state, conformed by the widget tree and all their properties. Test* uses the accessibility API of the underlying operating system. This API provides direct access to the entire widget tree, their properties such as: their position, size, whether the widget is enabled or focused, and further attributes like text, title or any associated value. For example <<accessibility-calculator>> shows the set of properties the accessibility API provides for a button of the Calculator application in MacOS. Using the accessibility API, Test* can target any graphical application that respects the accessibility conventions.

By inspecting the GUI state ,the tool is able to derive a set of possible actions. The tool automatically skips actions that are not meaningful like clicking on buttons that are hidden by other windows. The tool can also be configured with custom, more complex actions, targeting personalized widgets, and even actions to avoid, like closing the main window.

At each step, the tool randomly selects one of the identified actions. While this selection is random, the tool implements more intelligent mechanisms to identify action that are likely to trigger failures, such as actions that not executed often during the process. This action selection step can be customized as well. After the action has been selected, the state is updated and the process continues until some desired stopping conditions are met.

Each state reached by Test* is inspected for failures. By default, the tool checks implicit oracles similar to those we discussed for fuzzing like: the presence of application crashed and hangs. The tool also allows to specify other oracles like detecting error pop-ups from their messages or more complex assertions.

If a crash is found, then the whole action sequence to that point is stored with screenshots of the failure and the intermediate steps. Test* has been able to find actual critical failures in industry-level applications <<rueda2015testar>>.
